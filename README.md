# memory
A small game of Memory coded in C#. It is a prelude to a school project destined to learn C#.

# 1-Player Rules :
The board is made of 20 cards.
The cards are all displayed for 10 seconds at the beggining of the game.
Then they're turned upside down.

The player has to chose one card, then find the other card with the same symbol.

If he finds the right card, the pair is removed from the board, and he earns 10 points.

However if he fails to find the right card, he loses 5 points and the cards are turned back.
The game continues until there are no more cards left.

The goal is to get as many points as possible.
